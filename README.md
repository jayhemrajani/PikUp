# PikUp
This is the beginning of an app that I will continue to work on, starting in python.
This app will be allow for users to register an account, and proceed to find or create events for any pickup sport they desire to play.

To use for now, run the code in: 
Pikup.py
It will create a number of .txt files on your computer for which you can check and verify its functionality.
